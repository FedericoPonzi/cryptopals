//!Crypto Challenge Set 3
//!
//! This is the next set of block cipher cryptography challenges (even the randomness stuff here
//! plays into block cipher crypto).
//!
//! This set is moderately difficult. It includes a famous attack against CBC mode, and a "cloning"
//! attack on a popular RNG that can be annoying to get right.
//!
//! We've also reached a point in the crypto challenges where all the challenges, with one possible
//! exception, are valuable in breaking real-world crypto.
//!
