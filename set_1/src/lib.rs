//!Crypto Challenge Set 1
//!
//! This is the qualifying set. We picked the exercises in it to ramp developers up gradually into
//! coding cryptography, but also to verify that we were working with people who were ready to write code.
//!
//! This set is relatively easy. With one exception, most of these exercises should take only a
//! couple minutes. But don't beat yourself up if it takes longer than that. It took Alex two weeks
//! to get through the set!
//!
//! If you've written any crypto code in the past, you're going to feel like skipping a lot of this.
//! Don't skip them. At least two of them (we won't say which) are important stepping stones to later attacks.
//!
